# [Preview] Version 0.2.10

### ⚠️ ⚠️ Please read the notes below before upgrading from `v0.1.x` ⚠️ ⚠️ 

Version 0.2 is here, but be warned: this is considered a beta release at this time. What does that mean? In short, the odds of you running into some bugs or quirks are definitely higher than on the previous releases. The more users who try it out though, the faster we can fix any bugs that you find.

This release is a maintenance release to fix another bug introduced in the v0.2.x series.

Here's the highlights of this release:

- **Placeholder category options**: 
  - You can finally enable/disable placeholder categories again!
  - This one has been hanging around for a while but for some reason it still worked on my (extremely cursed) setup, which made it hard to debug
  - As such, we switched the placeholders to use the same enable/disable system as stickers so you can now enable and disable your placeholder categories to your heart's content.

Thanks to the users who reported these issues across the last few releases. If you notice other changes in how the settings, modes or overrides work after this update, please raise an issue. In short, this version completely changes a lot of things behind the scenes, and adds some smaller features. That being said: there's a few new features and fixes you might like in the 0.2.x release tree up to now:

- **Hardcore Options**
  - These are special options that once enabled *cannot be disabled* again. These options allow for a more stringent experience for users who prefer their censoring experience that way.
  - To start with, we have two hardcore options, both related to local censoring: Forcing overwriting originals, and enforcing active overrides
  - You can find the new Hardcore Options in the Danger Zone section of the extension options.
- Fix placeholder loading and some duplicate permission prompts
- Cleaned up some parts of the extension to be faster and more responsive.
- Improved domain lists (allow and block lists) to work the way they should have the whole time
- Images are now hidden before censoring starts

Thanks to many BP users for reporting issues and requesting features.
